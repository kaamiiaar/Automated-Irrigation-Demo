## Description
This project demonstrates an automated irrigation system that utilizes weather and soil moisture data from sensors connected to an ESP8266 board. The system captures environmental data, sends it to a cloud database, and automates irrigation based on soil moisture levels. The project integrates temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors, along with a relay module.

## Features
#### Data Collection
Leveraging ESP8266 for real-time data acquisition from various sensors.
#### Cloud Integration
Sending sensor data to a cloud-based database (000webhost.com is used as host to view the demo file; localhost could be used alternatively).
#### Automated Irrigation 
Triggering irrigation processes when soil moisture falls below a set threshold.

## Installation
Detailed instructions on setting up the ESP8266 board with sensors and connecting to the cloud database.

## Usage
Guidelines on operating the system, adjusting thresholds, and interpreting data.

## Potential for Improvement
Developed in one week, this demo has significant scope for enhancements in efficiency, data accuracy, and scalability.
